This is a basic calculator built using python that evaluates an expression containing  /,*,+,- operators.

Challenges faced:
1. Firstly, a method had to developed to retreive the expression from string input of the user.
This included typecasting of digits from string to float datatype and separating the operators.
2. Then, a finally a function was needed that evaluates the expression.
Here, a recursive function has been used to perform this task.
3. Then, It was also important to develop a way/function that considers oprations like +-+, /-, *-, etc. and develop a meaningful operation out of it.
So, another function was written that does this task.
